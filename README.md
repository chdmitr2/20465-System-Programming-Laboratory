# 20465-System-Programming-Laboratory
 This is a basic course in application programming. It provides students with the fundamental knowledge and tools required for further studies in software development. As special emphasis is on portability, all exercises are tested in parallel on two operating systems. As the C language is strongly connected with the Unix family of operating systems, the laboratory uses Linux, a variant of this family. By the end of the course, students will reach the level of experienced Linux users.
